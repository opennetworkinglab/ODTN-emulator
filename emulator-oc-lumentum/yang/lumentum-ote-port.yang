  description
    "This module describes the operation and control for physical ports. A 
     physical port is defined by a connector on the faceplate of the card or 
     pack. 

     The type physical-port is a base definition containing very few 
     parameters. The physical-port is intended to be augmented with port 
     extensions which complete the full port instance. For example, a
     bi-directional optical port would include optical-input and optical-output
     extensions. 

     This module also includes the OAM managed-port definition. The base
     physical-port definition does not assume the port is managed.

     Extensions to the port definition come from other modules. The extensions
     on a specific port are indicated by the list of extensions indicated on 
     the port via the port-extension list.
